# Hide-Private-Content Wordpress Plugin.
* Free (no upgrade to Pro rubbish ad banners or monthly payments costing infinite $)
* Works with Wordpress Multi-Site
* Even works with WooCommerce shop pages

Usage:
Simply activate the plugin and any posts or pages marked as 'private' in the Quick Edit menu will be hidden from site
including all posts, pages and menus unless the user is logged in. If the URL is visited directly the user will 
simply be redirected to the Home Page.
